    <h1>Roasted Broccoli</h1>

    <h2>Simple roasted broccoli</h2>
    <p>Roasted broccoli is easy to make and so much more flavorsome than boiled broccoli. My favorite part is the roasted sliced stem pieces.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 ounces broccoli</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes</li>
    </ol>
