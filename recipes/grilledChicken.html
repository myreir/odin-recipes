    <h1>Grilled Chicken</h1>

    <h2>The perfect grilled chicken recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe offers detailed instructions for marinating and grilling skinless, boneless chicken breasts. You can't ask for an easier or more delicious meal! The marinated breasts pair perfectly with just about anything, and they're the perfect choice for busy weeknights or your pickiest dinner guests.
        This marinade is ideal for grilling or baking any cut of chicken. Use it for breasts, thighs, wings, or drumsticks.
        No matter how you use it, it's important to discard the marinade as soon as you remove the meat (for food safety reasons, do not try to use it as a sauce or dressing).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 boneless/skinless chicken breasts thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, olive oil, parsley, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil the grate. Drain and discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
